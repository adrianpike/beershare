<p>This agreement is entered into this ___ day of ___ 20__ by and between _____________ (hereinafter "The Helper" or "You") and _____________ (hereinafter "The Project Owner" or "I") regarding a project that The Project Owner is requesting assistance on from The Helper (hereinafter "The Project").</p> 
 
<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong> I have an interesting project that I would like your assistance working on, with the mutual understanding that you are my friend and won't screw me.</p> 
 
<p>Manners of screwing include, but are not limited to:</p> 
<ol>
	<li>Adapting some or all of The Project for your own purposes.</li>
	<li>Bringing in others to the project without first checking with me.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a "warm blanket" agreement with which, by requesting your agreement to it, I am helping myself sleep at night by placing a small amount of formality on the sharing of The Idea. I believe The Idea will only improve as a result of having solicited your honest and clear feedback.</p> 
 
<strong>Term</strong> 

<p>The term of this agreement shall continue for the lifetime of The Project.</p>
 
<strong>Ownership</strong>

<p>I retain sole ownership and control of The Project, and any intellectual properties that may arise from it.</p>
<p>If The Project is already under a license agreement, including but not limited to any Creative Commons, GPL, or other Open Source license, it shall remain under that agreement.</p>

<strong>Profit, Revenue, and Sharing</strong>

<p>If I manage to make any money off of The Project, I agree to be fair and equitable with all parties involved with The Project, possibly but not guaranteed to include picking up the tab at meals and providing beer to the team.</p>

<strong>Breach</strong> 
 
<p>This agreement has absolutely no legal binding. However, upon breach or violation of the agreement, I will feel free to do any of the following:</p> 
 
<ol> 
	<li>Curse you under my breath. </li> 
	<li>Publicly disclose the manner of your screw-i-tude.</li> 
	<li>Write about your transgressions in ALL CAPS. </li> 
	<li>No longer consider you a person with whom I can share my ideas.</li> 
</ol> 
 
<strong>Sharing</strong> 
 
<p>Sharing of some or all of The Project, and/or bringing in additional third parties to assist with The Project may occur provided that you have cleared this with me and the third parties agree to the principles of the BeerShare.</p>
 
<strong>Termination</strong> 
 
<p>Termination of this BeerShare agreement can be executed by either party, but don't be a jerk about it.</p> 
 
<p>You are acknowledging and agreeing to this disclosure by reading it. If you find any part of this agreement uncomfortable or confusing, don't sweat it. We'll talk about something else.</p>
